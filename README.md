This project is made thanks to the UltimatePortfolio course of Paul Hudson. It teaches me how to build one app that covers *all* the core techniques of app building. This means we're covering a huge range of SwiftUI, including architecture, accessibility, and localization. We're covering good project hygiene, such as testing, documentation, and structure. And we're covering core system technologies, such as networking, Core Data, and iCloud, while also working across iOS, macOS, tvOS, and even watchOS.

## What have I learned in this series?
### Part 1 : Building the Core App
* SwiftUI
* Core Data 
* Using Git
* Internationalization and localization
* Accessibility 
* Providing sample data for canvas previews.
* Various Xcode tips and tricks
* SwiftLint
* Documenting the code
* Testing (Unit & UI)
* Measuring performance
* MVVM
### Part 2 : Integrating with the system
* Haptics
* Integrating with Spotlight
* Local notifications
* StoreKit (In-app purchasing)
* Quick Action (SwiftUI/UIKit bridge)
* Shortcuts integration
* Widgets
* Sync data across iCloud-connected devices
* ...
### Part 3 : Going cross-platform
_Coming soon!_

## Prerequisites
* iOS 14.0 / Xcode 12.5 / Swift 5.3
* Some features, like testing VoiceOver, require a physical device instead of the simulator.
* SwiftLint is used to generate linter warnings when building the app.
